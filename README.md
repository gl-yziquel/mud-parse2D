# mud-parse2D

Toying with [python-parse-2d][parse2d].

## Context

[Current code](src/mud_parse2D/__main__.py) parses the content of a 2D text box.

There  is  a  dearth  of  well structured  parsing  toolkits  for  textual  data
or  textual   programming  languages  with   a  2D  layout.  One   exception  is
`python-parse-2d`, which seems to work but may be, perhaps, too simplistic for
[our needs][needs]. So we need to check it out in some details to evaluate it.

[needs]: https://github.com/madman-bob/python-parse-2d/issues/1#issue-2337951670

Ideally, we  would like to be  able to detect two  boxes randomly laid out  on a
page. The [toody][toody] comonadic parser  combinator haskell library is claimed
to handle that,  but it does not build  out of the box anymore.  It is cursorily
discussed on [reddit][toody-reddit].

If  you  know of  other  2D  text parsing  toolkits,  please  let me  know.  The
problematics relevant to 2D parsing notably include various markdown parsings;
[markdeep][markdeep] for instance. The comonadic structure also appears in the [ascii art to unicode parsing technology][ascii-art-parse].

## Build system considerations

Caveat: the project builds out of the box, provided you have the same toolkit as
me: just, fd,  par, bat / batcat, hatch,  tomlq for python yq, sed.  If you have
that, you're good to go. If you don't, leave me a note, and I'll attempt to make
my setup as portable as possible.

Type `just` for the list of commands at your disposal to manage the project.
